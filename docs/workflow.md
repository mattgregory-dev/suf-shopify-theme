# Workflow

## Environment: the CLI lives in WSL

The repo is on the WSL filesystem. If your shell is Windows-side (Git Bash,
PowerShell) it cannot see WSL binaries, so run WSL-side commands as:

```
wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-24.04 -- bash -lc 'cd ~/projects/suf/theme && shopify ...'
```

Wrap the command in **single** quotes. The outer shell will otherwise expand
`$PATH`, `$?` etc. before WSL sees them — this silently produces wrong results
rather than an error (e.g. `echo "$PATH" | grep npm-global` returns the Windows
PATH and reports a false negative). Use `printenv PATH` when inspecting.

For anything longer than one line, write a script file and run
`bash script.sh` instead of inlining. Nested quoting through two shells fails in
ways that look like environment problems.

`~/.npm-global/bin` is on the PATH in both `~/.profile` and `~/.bashrc`, each
behind a `case` guard so it is not added twice. Note this means `bash -lc` works
but bare `bash -c` does not — that mode reads neither file.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | `sass --watch` → `assets/suf.css` |
| `npm run css:build` | One-off compressed build |
| `npm run deploy` | `css:build` then `shopify theme push` |
| `npm run lint` | Theme Check |
| `npm run format` | Prettier — **scoped to `frontend/` + `suf.js` only** |
| `shopify theme dev` | Local server. Hot-reloads CSS and sections by default. |

Normal loop is two terminals: `npm run dev` alongside `shopify theme dev`.

`shopify theme dev` already provides hot reload for CSS and sections — it
defaults to `--live-reload hot-reload`. That is not a reason to add a bundler.

## Linting

`.theme-check.yml` extends `theme-check:recommended`.

- **Baseline is ~719 offenses. This is inherited and expected** for a Vintage
  theme (`DeprecatedFilter`, `DeprecatedTag`, lazysizes). **Do not mass-fix.**
  Treat it as a ratchet: lint new work, leave the legacy count alone. It was
  ~1,080 before unreferenced sections and snippets were removed.
- **Trap: `--fail-level` does not work.** Verified on CLI 3.92.1 — exits `0`
  with 178 errors present, at every level. CI gating must parse
  `--output json` and count offenses itself.
- **`LiquidHTMLSyntaxError` is suppressed for four files.** They are JavaScript;
  Theme Check parses `.liquid` assets with its LiquidHTML parser, which misreads
  `if (qty <= 0)` and `innerHTML = '<a href="'...` as broken markup. The code is
  valid — do not "fix" it. See the comment in `.theme-check.yml`.
- A file that fails to parse gets **no other checks run on it**, so fixing a
  syntax error usually *raises* the offense count. That is more coverage, not a
  regression.
- Some `MissingAsset` offenses are real 404s inherited from the theme, e.g.
  `assets/loading.gif` is referenced but absent. Production has the file.

## Formatting

Prettier + `@shopify/prettier-plugin-liquid`, configured but **deliberately not
run across the theme** — reformatting the inherited files would destroy
`git blame` on code nobody has read yet. `npm run format` is scoped to new code;
editor format-on-save covers files you actively touch, so formatting converges
naturally.

## Line endings

`.gitattributes` pins `eol=lf`. SVGs are excluded (`*.svg -text`) — one had
`CRCRLF` endings and normalizing them is pure churn.

`git add --renormalize .` would touch **268 files** and has intentionally not
been run. If you ever do it, make it one isolated commit.

## Committing

**Do not commit unless told to.** Leave finished work in the working tree,
unstaged, and report what is ready. This applies to `git add`, `--amend`,
rebases and branch rewrites too. Changes are reviewed before anything enters
history.

### Commit messages

- **Do not add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer.** Omit it entirely.
- Subject line, imperative mood, conventional-commit prefix.
- **Write a body only when there is a trap or a non-obvious consequence** —
  something a dev acting on the commit needs and cannot get from the diff.
- Skip the body entirely when the subject says it all.
- Background and architecture belong in `docs/`, not in `git log`. But note
  these docs are the only versioned record, so a body must be self-contained:
  do not write "see the docs" in place of the fact itself.

## Assistant context files are not tracked

`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and equivalents are gitignored. They are tooling for
whichever coding agent a developer uses, not part of the theme, so the repo
stays agnostic about which one that is. Keep a local stub pointing at `docs/`.
